# Coding Interview question 

To get an internship, I had had to use REST API to scrape every course name, course id, url, professor, description, and number of subscribers on Udemy website. 

I have optimized udemy.py to run it faster with an automated bash script so that I do not need to run command lines on terminal for every request.
